# Improvement ideas for the future
<ul>
  <li>When creating/adding a new employee also create a username and password for the employee</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Currently only admins can use the software, but adding in usage for regular employees with basically only view access</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Publishing</li>
  <li>Incorporating emails, so that for example when a change is made to a project a user is in they get notified</li>
  <li>"Notes" or something similiar for projects and customers</li>
  <li>Log-info for everything that happens on a companys site so that an admin can see what changes have been made and by who</li>
</ul>
